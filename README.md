## Visit Level Calculation

The application calculates the visit level based on the following time-based coding:

### New Patient

-   Level 1: Up to 20 minutes
-   Level 2: 21-30 minutes
-   Level 3: 31-45 minutes
-   Level 4: 46-60 minutes
-   Level 5: 61+ minutes

### Established Patient

-   Level 1: Up to 10 minutes
-   Level 2: 11-20 minutes
-   Level 3: 21-30 minutes
-   Level 4: 31-40 minutes
-   Level 5: 41+ minutes

### Phone Visit

-   Level 1: Up to 10 minutes
-   Level 2: 11-20 minutes
-   Level 3: 21+ minutes

## 99417 Extended Code

The 99417 extended code is displayed when the time exceeds the threshold for new and established patients. The threshold is 75 minutes for new patients and 55 minutes for established patients. The code is displayed as "99417 x N" where N is the number of 15-minute increments over the threshold.
